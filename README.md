# unity-sprout-ggj

This game was created in February 3 - 5, 2023 during the Global Game Jam Tucson Site. It is called Sprout. The objective was to get your plant to reach the water pool at the end of a level while avoiding salt and collecting water droplets in the soil.
My club, UA Game Dev Club, was the cohost for the event with the Tucson Game Developers club, as my username was Ravenorr. The game was
not formally submitted as I was trying to fix bugs related to the game. Here is the link to the event: https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/ggj-tucson-2023

I am now adding changes and bug fixes. Here are some gifs from one of the levels in the game.
